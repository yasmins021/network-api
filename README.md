# Social Network Web Application API

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. The API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, Mongoose for data modeling, and the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps. The seed data is created using Insomnia.
