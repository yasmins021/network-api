# Social Network Web Application API

This API serves as the backend for a social network web application that enables users to express their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and manage their friends list. The API leverages Express.js for handling routing, a MongoDB database for data storage, Mongoose for data modeling, and the JavaScript Date object to properly format timestamps. To initialize the database with initial data, the seed data is generated using Insomnia..
